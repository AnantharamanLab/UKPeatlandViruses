model <- lmer(virus_host_ratio ~ treatment * `Host Family` +

              data = virus_host_abundance_indiv %>%
              filter(`Host Family` != "Unknown"))
anova_ii <- Anova(model, type = "II")
anova_ii
anova_iii <- Anova(model, type = "III")
anova_iii

anova_combined<- rbind(as.data.frame(anova_ii) %>% mutate(Test = "Type II ANOVA"),
                       as.data.frame(anova_iii) %>% mutate(Test = "Type III ANOVA"))
write.csv(anova_combined, file = "../Tables/virus_host_abundance_anova.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

Hereâs how to interpret the results from your ANOVA (both Type II and Type III):

### **Type II ANOVA Interpretation:**

- **treatment** (`p = 0.29659`): The effect of treatment alone is not significant. This means that when considering the main effect of treatment across all host families, without accounting for interactions, the treatment does not significantly influence the `virus_host_ratio`.
  
- **`Host Family`** (`p = 0.01389`): The effect of host family is significant, indicating that different host families have different average `virus_host_ratio`, regardless of the treatment.

- **treatment:`Host Family` Interaction** (`p < 0.0001`): The interaction between treatment and host family is highly significant. This means that the effect of treatment on `virus_host_ratio` differs depending on the host family, which is crucial for understanding how specific treatments affect different host families.

### **Type III ANOVA Interpretation:**

- **(Intercept)** (`p = 0.1465326`): The intercept is not significant, which is typical and generally less informative in the context of understanding treatment and host family effects.

- **treatment** (`p = 0.0002903`): The treatment effect is significant in the Type III ANOVA. This indicates that after accounting for the interaction with host family, the treatment significantly affects the `virus_host_ratio`. This is an important finding because it suggests that some of the treatment effects were masked when not considering the interaction.

- **`Host Family`** (`p = 0.0075189`): The host family effect remains significant, reinforcing the idea that different host families have inherently different `virus_host_ratio` values.

- **treatment:`Host Family` Interaction** (`p < 0.0001`): The interaction between treatment and host family is still highly significant, confirming that the impact of treatment varies by host family.

### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Significant Interaction (treatment Ã Host Family):** The most critical finding is the highly significant interaction between treatment and host family. This indicates that the effect of treatment on the `virus_host_ratio` is not uniform across all host families. Different treatments impact different host families in varied ways.

2. **Treatment Effect (from Type III ANOVA):** The treatment effect is significant when considering the interaction with host families. This suggests that, overall, treatments do influence the `virus_host_ratio`, but this effect is modulated by the specific host family involved.

3. **Host Family Effect:** Different host families have different average `virus_host_ratio` values, suggesting intrinsic differences in how these families interact with viruses.
